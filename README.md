#  BrightVision Web App

A powerful web-based application built using **Streamlit** that brings together four cutting-edge computer vision features in one place:

1. **üîç Object Detection using Grounding DINO**
2. **üí° Low-Light Image Enhancement**
3. **‚úÇÔ∏è Background Removal**
4. **üéØ Segment Anything Model (SAM)**

## üöÄ Features

### 1. Object Detection with Grounding DINO
- Detect and locate objects in images using natural language prompts.
- Combines DINO and Grounding capabilities for zero-shot object detection.
